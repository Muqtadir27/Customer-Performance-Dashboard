# Customer-Performance-Dashboard
This repository includes two interactive Customer Performance Dashboards in Light and Dark themes. These dashboards provide a detailed analysis of customer demographics, revenue segmentation, and key performance indicators, allowing businesses to make data-driven decisions based on customer insights. Built with data visualization best practices, each dashboard offers a comprehensive view of customer data, segmented by factors such as age group, gender, and customer profile.

# Project Overview
The Customer Performance Dashboard is designed to help stakeholders identify patterns and trends across customer data, with actionable insights into areas like customer loyalty, revenue contribution, and demographic analysis.

# Key Features and Visualizations
Customer Age and Count:
Displays the average customer age and total customer count in a summary panel. This provides a snapshot of the customer demographics, helping businesses tailor their strategies to their audience’s age profile.

Revenue Segmentation by Age Group:
Analyzes revenue contributions across different age segments, offering insights into high-value customer groups. This helps in focusing marketing efforts on the most profitable demographics.

Customer Profiling (Loyal, Periodic, VIP):
Segment customers into categories based on engagement levels, such as loyal, periodic, and VIP. These categories aid in targeted customer relationship strategies, helping businesses invest in customer retention where it matters most.

Gender-Based Earnings:
A breakdown of revenue contribution by gender, highlighting gender-specific trends in purchasing behavior. This information can guide marketing teams in crafting personalized campaigns.

Customers with and Without Children:
Highlights customer demographics with and without children, analyzing the revenue generated by each segment. This can be useful for understanding family-oriented customer preferences and targeting products accordingly.

Top Customers:
Lists the top 5 customers based on their contribution, providing insights into key accounts that drive the most revenue.

# Technical Approach
The dashboard was developed with a focus on data transformation, segmentation, and visualization. Here’s a breakdown of the technical process:

Data Cleaning and Transformation:
Used Python and SQL to preprocess and clean raw data, ensuring accuracy and consistency in each segment. Data was then structured to support efficient querying and filtering in the dashboard.

Data Visualization:
Created visualizations in Power BI for dynamic reporting, allowing users to filter by multiple variables (such as age group and customer status). Visuals were optimized to load quickly and provide real-time insights to users.

Theme Customization:
Developed two themes—Light and Dark—to enhance usability based on the viewer’s environment and preference, leveraging Power BI's customization capabilities.

Data Mapping and Segmentation:
Implemented advanced segmentation methods to identify high-value customer groups. By mapping revenue data across various demographics, the dashboard provides clear insights into customer distribution and revenue sources.
